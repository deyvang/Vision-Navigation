## Introduction
The Pothole Detection System aims to automate the detection of potholes on roads using advanced image processing algorithms and machine learning models. This project contributes to safer driving conditions and better road maintenance.

## Features
- **Real-time pothole detection**: Processes video feeds to identify potholes in real-time.
- **Image classification**: Analyzes static images for pothole presence and severity.
- **Alerts and notifications**: Sends alerts for detected potholes for immediate action.
- **Data logging**: Logs detected potholes with GPS coordinates for maintenance scheduling.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/username/pothole-detection-system.git
   cd pothole-detection-system
   ```
2. Install required dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Dataset
The dataset comprises images and videos of roads with labeled potholes. It can be obtained from [source link]. Organize the dataset according to the instructions in the `data/` directory.

## Model Architecture
The model architecture is based on the YOLOv8 algorithm, designed to efficiently detect and classify potholes. Detailed architecture information is available in the `model/` directory.

## Training
The training process involves feeding the labeled dataset into the model and optimizing its parameters. Training scripts and detailed instructions can be found in the `train/` directory.

## Evaluation
Evaluate the model's performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Evaluation scripts and guidelines are provided in the `evaluate/` directory.

## Usage
After training and evaluating the model, use it for real-world pothole detection. Usage instructions and examples are available in the `usage/` directory.
